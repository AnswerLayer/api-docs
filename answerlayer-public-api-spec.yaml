    ## Conversational Analytics Platform
    
    AnswerLayer enables SaaS companies to embed conversational analytics directly into their existing product dashboards. 
    This API allows you to programmatically manage your clients and their users, while providing natural language querying 
    capabilities over your centralized data warehouse.
    
    ### Architecture
    
    The API follows a hierarchical structure designed for embedding analytics into your product:
    
    ```
    Your Organization (API Customer)
    ├── Database Connections (Your Data Warehouse)
    ├── Clients (Your Customers)
    │   ├── Users (Your Customers' Users)
    │   ├── Questions & Conversations (Auto-scoped to client data)
    │   └── Charts & Visualizations
    └── API Keys & Authentication
    ```
    
    ### Use Case Example
    
    A company like Anthropic could use AnswerLayer to:
    1. Connect their usage analytics database containing all client data
    2. Create client records for each of their customers  
    3. Embed conversational analytics into their customer dashboard
    4. Allow each client to ask questions about their own usage data
    
    AnswerLayer automatically ensures data isolation - each client only sees their own data.
    
    ### Authentication
    
    All API requests require authentication using API keys. Include your API key in the `Authorization` header:
    
    ```
    Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
    ```
  
    ### Error Handling
    
    The API uses standard HTTP status codes and returns JSON error responses:
    
    ```json
    {
      "error": {
        "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
        "message": "Invalid client_id provided",
        "details": "Client with ID 'abc123' not found"
      }
    }
    ```
